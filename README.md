# Our Beloved Game

This is an app made to display information about the players of our beloved game, the Bachelor / Bachelorette. At the moment, it only covers Bachelorette Seasons 17 & 20. It is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and is hosted by Netlify. 

The data for this site is currently JSON files exported from Google Sheets: [This is the current season's Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mCZUyzOJ8KB1h2U5U_IBd1KO0M7ybR7bQOQhzsZOaL4/edit?usp=sharing). If you'd like to have edit access to this file, you can request access via the Google Sheet.

## Contribution ðŸŒ¹

This is just for fun and I'd love to have other people contribute if they'd like. If you have ideas / edits you'd like to create, let's use Issues to start the conversation. Then we can move to PR -> approval -> deploy (Netlify automatically deploys changes that are merged to main). You can also just start with a PR and surprise me ðŸ˜‚. 

Please also feel free to submit bugs as Issues and I'll try to tackle them as I go.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
